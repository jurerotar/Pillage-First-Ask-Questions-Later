**Pillage First! (Ask Questions Later)** is an **open-source**, **single-player**, **strategy game** inspired by
Travian.

**Build villages**, **manage resources**, **train troops**, **start adventures** and **wage war** in **persistent**, **offline-first** game
worlds. It requires no account or download.

Game mechanics are inspired by both Travian Legends and Travian Kingdoms. It's built to be as **light-weight as
possible**, providing you a **great experience even on older devices**. It iterates on the original design, introduces **new
features** and **improves on the existing ones**!

Remember: pillage first, ask questions later! ⚔️🔥

# Motivation

I've always been a huge fan of Travian and similar browser-based strategy games. The slow, methodical village-building,
resource management, and real-time progression made those games incredibly special.

Sadly, Travian requires a massive time (and gold!) investment to remain competitive. Not being able to commit either of
these, I set out to create a similar, but **less commitment-hungry experience**, with more **quality-of-life features** and **customizability** to make
your experience better!

**Pillage First!** is my attempt to recreate that experience as a **single-player Travian alternative**, with the same
core mechanics, but modernized, **offline-friendly**, and **fully open source**, with no game mechanics to incentivize
spending real-world money. Just the classic gameplay loop, reimagined for solo play.
