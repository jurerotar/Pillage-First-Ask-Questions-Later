# Pillage First! (Ask Questions Later)

Pillage First! (Ask Questions Later) is an **open-source**, **single-player** **strategy game** inspired by Travian.

Build villages, manage resources, train troops, and wage war in **persistent**, **massive**, **offline-first** game worlds. It requires no account or
download.

Game mechanics are inspired by both Travian Legends and Travian Kingdoms. It's designed to be as light-weight as possible, giving you a
great experience even on older devices. It is not a Travian clone per se, because it iterates on the original design and introduces new
mechanics.

You can see the current stable version at: [pillagefirst.netlify.app](https://pillagefirst.netlify.app)

Remember: pillage first, ask questions later! ⚔️🔥

# Motivation

I've always been a huge fan of Travian and similar browser-based strategy games. The slow, methodical village-building, resource management,
and real-time progression made those games special.

Sadly, Travian requires a massive time (and gold!) investment to remain competitive. Not being able to commit either of these, I set out to
create a similar, but less commitment-hungry experience.

**Pillage First!** is my attempt to recreate that experience as a **single-player Travian alternative**, with the same core mechanics, but
modernized,
**offline-friendly**, and **fully open source**, with no game mechanics to incentivize spending real-world money. Just the classic gameplay
loop,
reimagined for solo play.

### Can this project be converted to multiplayer?

**Yes!** This project was actually rebuilt from the ground up to make it as compatible as possible with a potential backend integration.
You can find more technical details on how the app works and how a backend integration might look like
in [ARCHITECTURE.md](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

That being said, the current goal is to keep this repository as a standalone, offline-first app focused on single-player gameplay.

One of the hopes for the future of this project is that someone might eventually fork the project, restructure it, and connect it to a
backend, enabling a multiplayer experience. Most of the frontend can be completely reused, making the transition easier than starting from
scratch.

If you’re passionate about backend development and want to help bring multiplayer to life — feel free to reach out!

### Why single-player?

There are several reasons, but I’ll focus on the main ones.

The first is scope. Even in its current state, the app spans tens of thousands of lines of code — and it’s still far from complete. Adding a
full backend would effectively double the workload, making the project nearly impossible to finish as a solo developer working on this in my
spare time.

The second reason is personal. Building a complex frontend-only app at this scale is a unique challenge, and I wanted to see how far I could
push it. This project gives me the opportunity to explore problems you don’t usually encounter in typical frontend work.

### Are there game design differences between Travian and Pillage First!?

Yes, there's a couple. Main ones are new buildings, more playable tribes, removal of capital village mechanic and new hero items. Game
design is always being discussed in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ep7NKVXUZA), so feel free to join if
you'd like to join the conversation and share your opinion!
