  ## Version 0.3.0
  #### Feb 26, 2026

  <Alert variant="error">
    <span>This version introduces breaking changes</span>
  </Alert>

  <FeaturesBlock>
    * Added hero adventures! Too long have our heroes sat idly by. No longer! You’ll now have an option to send hero on
    adventures to gather loot and experience! <br />
    Adventures will take anywhere from 8 to 12 minutes, and are scaled with game world speed.<br />
    Each adventure will cost your hero some health points; 5 to be exact. This can be reduced by wearing damage-reducing
    gear!<br />
    Your hero earns experience each time it completes an adventure. It currently receives `10 *
    (number_of_completed_adventures + 1)` experience per successful adventure!<br />
    Your hero will receive loot on successfully finishing an adventure. We’re currently still missing loot tables, so
    this is coming in a later patch, along with hero inventory interface.<br />

  </FeaturesBlock>

  <BugFixesBlock>
    * Fixed an issue where some occupiable oasis did not have proper resource bonuses and animals generated.

    * Fixed an issue where not all occupiable oasis were shown in Hero's Mansion.
  </BugFixesBlock>

  <PerformanceBlock>
    * Improved database seeding performance and reduced overall size of the database file. We implemented 2 separate
    changes in regards to database. First one reduced overall database size by around 10-30% percent, depending on game
    world size. Second one cut the time to seed the database by over 50% on game worlds of all sizes. This results in
    faster game world creation, as well as better performance while in game!
  </PerformanceBlock>

  <TechnicalImprovementBlock>
    * Improved database breaking changes detection. App will now more consistently detect outdated game worlds.

<section>
  ## Version 0.2.1

  </Alert>

  <FeaturesBlock>
    * Added hero attributes page. You're now able to see all your hero attributes. There are some additional attributes
    which are not shown (cranny plunder,...). These options will be added in a later patch. Page also allows you to
    change
    hero's ability points, along with the ability to switch hero resource production focus. The dropdown shows you
    production values to expect on change.

    * A "hero level up" option has been added to developer tools.

    training,...).

    * Fixed an issue where environment variables weren't getting injected.
  </BugFixesBlock>

  <PerformanceBlock>
    * Improved performance of resolving events. Updating resources query now doesn't run, if there's no change to

    **Long awaited engine rework is finally here!**

    This update is not compatible with existing game worlds and requires creation of new game worlds. Along with the
    engine rework, this update also brings the following features:

    * Player pages - you can now see player information, along with the list of villages they occupy.
    * Statistics pages - you can now see the ranking of all players and all villages, based on population.
    * Game world overview page - you can now see the split of tribes, factions and basic game world information.
    * Oasis bonus finder - long gone are the days of manually checking the map for your perfect location of your next
    village. This tool allows you to find all tiles with specific resource composition and bonuses!
    * Reworked developer tools - you may now toggle instant completion and free-cost of insectionidual event types, add or
    remove resources, add adventure points or spawn hero items!
    * Tons of new quests - we've expanded the quest list from humble 160 to over 1000. More will get added as
    development
    continues!
  </FeaturesBlock>

  <TechnicalImprovementBlock>
    From technical improvement perspective, we haven't been idling. New version fixes the long-standing issue of game
    world state corruption, it massively improves developer experience and speed, adds over 200 tests and enables us to
    onboard new contributors easier! These changes were contributed by over 7 new contributors!
  </TechnicalImprovementBlock>

  ## Version 0.0.49
  #### Jan 26, 2026

  <PerformanceBlock>
    * We've improved the performance of the game world creation. You can expect 10-15% faster game world generation!
  </PerformanceBlock>
</section>

<section>
  ## Version 0.0.48
  #### Jan 19, 2026

  <FeaturesBlock>
    * You’ll now be able to start building upgrades faster on mobile! Simply press the building upgrade indicator for a
    second and the building will start upgrading, without you having to open the building interface and clicking the
    build
    button.
  </FeaturesBlock>
</section>

<section>
  ## Version 0.0.47
  #### Jan 7, 2026

  <PerformanceBlock>
    * We've reworked some of the scripts used in game-world generation and as a result, generation is now about 10-15%
    faster. This is especially important on larger worlds or when using a lower-end device, where generation may take a
    couple of seconds.
  </PerformanceBlock>

  <TechnicalImprovementBlock>
    * We transitioned repository to a monorepo. This came with some technical challenges, but also a ton of clarity.
    Project is now much simpler to navigate and reason about!

    * We've added oxlint to the project. This a new linting tool and its very promising. Plan is to use it side-by-side
    with Biome (our current linter), with the goal of eventually transitioning fully off of Biome.
  </TechnicalImprovementBlock>

<section>
  ## Version 0.0.46
  #### Jan 4, 2026

  <FeaturesBlock>
    * We added game-world-overview page. Thank you very much for your contribution!
  </FeaturesBlock>
</section>

<section>
  ## Version 0.0.45
  #### Dec 30, 2025

  <FeaturesBlock>
    * We added player pages! You'll now be able to see general information about each player, along with a list of
    their villages. Thank you very much for your contribution!
  </FeaturesBlock>
</section>

<section>
  ## Version 0.0.44
  #### Dec 24, 2025

  <FeaturesBlock>
    * UI color scheme (dark/light mode), graphic skin variant (default, snow,...), locale & graphics day-night setting
    are
    now persistent between game worlds. This doesn't mean much yet, because we don't have graphics, only support a
    single
    locale and don't have a dark mode yet, but once those things arrive, you'll be able to set them once and have the
    setting persist through all game worlds.
  </FeaturesBlock>

  <PerformanceBlock>
    * We've done a minor clean up. In this case, we managed to remove a minor dependency, which reduced the final bundle
    by
    about ~60kb.
  </PerformanceBlock>
</section>

<section>
  ## Version 0.0.43
  #### Dec 19, 2025

  <FeaturesBlock>
    * We now have a global not-found page. We've been seeing a small rise of routing errors lately. We're not sure if
    these
    are just bots trying different subpages, but in case some real users are getting lost, this should help them out a
    bit.

    * We've reworked the in-game error pages for game world not found and game world is already opened errors. Instead
    of
    being redirected to /404 or /403, you'll now remain inside the relevant game world url. This reduces the amount of
    clicks needed to solve a particular error.
  </FeaturesBlock>
</section>

<section>
  ## Version 0.0.42
  #### Dec 12, 2025

  <BugFixesBlock>
    * We've fixed an annoying layout shift, which appeared when changing between village and non-village pages!
  </BugFixesBlock>

  <PerformanceBlock>
    * We've substantially improved performance of the construct new building page. This page was actually flagged as one
    of
    the slowest pages we have. The reason for this is because in order to determine which buildings you're allowed to
    construct, we have to run a bunch of checks. While these checks are not that slow insectionidually, we had to run these
    checks multiple times for each building, which added up quickly. We've now reworked this to make it more efficient.
    You
    should be seeing faster page renders, especially on mid/lower-end devices.
  </PerformanceBlock>
