    ## We're always on the lookout for new contributors!

    Pillage First! is a community-driven project and we welcome help
    at every level. Whether you're a developer, tester, designer,
    artist or translator, there are lots of ways to contribute: fixing
    bugs, adding features, writing tests, improving UX, creating icons
    or translating the UI. The fastest way to get started is to say hi
    on our community channels (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/Ep7NKVXUZA">Discord</a>/<a rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jurerotar/Pillage-First-Ask-Questions-Later">GitHub</a>) or open an issue describing how you'd like to help and we'll
    point you to good first tasks and onboarding notes.

    ### Development

    Develop new features, improve existing ones or help keep the tech
    debt at a manageable level, there's plenty of challenges to go
    around. You'll need to be familiar with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` to
    start, but having knowledge in `React` or a similar frontend
    framework, `TypeScript`, `TailwindCSS` and `SQLite` will help you onboard
    faster.
  </div>

  <div>
    ### Testing

    Help us keep the game stable by playtesting, reproducing and
    triaging bugs. Useful contributions include clear bug reports with
    reproduction steps, testing the app for edge conditions or
    describing unclear parts of the app. Best way to report an issue
    is to raise it in our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/Ep7NKVXUZA">Discord server</a>, or raising a
    <a rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jurerotar/Pillage-First-Ask-Questions-Later/issues/new">GitHub issue</a>.

  <div>
    ### UI/UX design

    Improve flows, wireframes and accessibility. We need designers to
    create mockups and component specs (Figma or similar), propose
    interaction improvements, and help make the UI more intuitive
    across screen sizes. Deliverables can be design tokens, new
    component variants, prototype screens or just screenshots of
    features from other apps that you think would work well here.
  </div>

  <div>
    ### Graphic/icon design

    Create tile art, icons, sprites and page graphics. We prefer
    optimized web formats (AVIF/WebP) and source files (SVG, layered
    PSD/FIGMA) so we can iterate on existing work.
  </div>

  <div>
    ### Gameplay design

    Help balance NPC behavior, unit stats, quests and progression.
    Contributions here include game design ideas and documents,
    spreadsheets with balancing proposals and playtest plans.
  </div>

  <div>
    ### Localization

    Translate the game strings and help with phrasing in supported
    languages. We maintain i18n keys; translators should provide
    contextual translations and review them in-app to ensure they fit
    UI constraints. Even proofreading and suggestions for improved
    phrasing are extremely valuable.

      We currently accept only English localization changes!

  ## Other ways to help

  * Star & fork the project on GitHub! GitHub is still our main way of attracting new members to the Discord server. Starring and forking makes it more likely the project gets recommended to new people!

  * Share the people with your friends. More people means more ideas and a higher likelihood of finding additional developers, which would speed up development.
