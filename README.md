# Pillage First! (Ask Questions Later)

Pillage First! (Ask Questions Later) is an **open-source**, **single-player** **strategy game** inspired by Travian.

Build villages, manage resources, train troops, and wage war in **persistent**, **massive**, **offline-first** game
worlds. It requires no account or download.

Game mechanics are inspired by both Travian Legends and Travian Kingdoms. It's designed to be as light-weight as
possible, giving you a
great experience even on older devices. It is not a Travian clone per se, because it iterates on the original design and
introduces new features.

Remember: pillage first, ask questions later! ⚔️🔥

Stable version: [pillagefirst.com](https://pillagefirst.com)

Development version (contains latest features, but may be unstable): [develop--pillagefirst.netlify.app](https://develop--pillagefirst.netlify.app)

# Motivation

I've always been a huge fan of Travian and similar browser-based strategy games. The slow, methodical village-building,
resource management,
and real-time progression made those games special.

Sadly, Travian requires a massive time (and gold!) investment to remain competitive. Not being able to commit either of
these, I set out to
create a similar, but less commitment-hungry experience.

**Pillage First!** is my attempt to recreate that experience as a **single-player Travian alternative**, with the same
core mechanics, but
modernized,
**offline-friendly**, and **fully open source**, with no game mechanics to incentivize spending real-world money. Just
the classic gameplay
loop,
reimagined for solo play.

# Frequently asked questions

### What's the state of the project?

Project is pretty heavy in development! It's still missing a lot of major features. What's currently available is building construction, unit training, a couple of building interfaces, as well as secondary pages like production-overview, village-overview, preferences,...

### Is there a roadmap?

Due to the nature of this project (I get work on it only in my free time), I'm not willing to commit to any specific timeline for any features. That being said, here's the general plan for upcoming development:

- Engine rework (currently in development)
- Combat mechanics
- Trading mechanics
- Hero adventures, inventory,...

Bug fixing and other minor works will be made between these features.

### Can this project be converted to multiplayer?

**Yes!** This project was actually rebuilt from the ground up to make it as compatible as possible with a potential
backend integration.
You can find more technical details on how the app works and how a backend integration might look like
in [ARCHITECTURE.md](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

That being said, the current goal is to keep this repository as a standalone, offline-first app focused on single-player
gameplay.

One of the hopes for the future of this project is that someone might eventually fork the project, restructure it, and
connect it to a
backend, enabling a multiplayer experience. Most of the frontend can be completely reused, making the transition easier
than starting from
scratch.

If you're passionate about backend development and want to help bring multiplayer to life, feel free to reach out!

### Are there game design differences between Travian and Pillage First!?

Yes, there are a few! The main ones include new buildings, additional playable tribes, the removal of the capital
village mechanic, and new hero items. Game design is an ongoing conversation in
our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ep7NKVXUZA), so feel free to hop in and share your thoughts!

### Why not stick with the original?

While I love Travian, I (and many more like me) just don't have the time to commit to it
anymore. Pulling all-nighters, finding duals from across the world and making sure account is covered 24/7 was fun in
middle school, but it's not something I want to (or even can?) engage in now. I want to be able to take a break,
whenever life gets in the way, and for the game to respect that.

I want this game to be a more accessible, customizable and time-friendly version of Travian.
