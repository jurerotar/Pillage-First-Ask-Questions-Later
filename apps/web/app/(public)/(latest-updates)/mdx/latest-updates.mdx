  ## Version 0.0.47
  #### Jan 7, 2026

  * We transitioned repository to a monorepo. This came with some technical challenges, but also a ton of clarity. Project
  is now much simpler to navigate and reason about!

  * I've added oxlint to the project. This a new linting tool and its very promising. Plan is to use it side-by-side
  with Biome (our current linter), with the goal of eventually transitioning fully off of Biome.

  * I've reworked some of the scripts used in game-world generation and as a result, generation is now about 10-15%
  faster. This is especially important on larger worlds or when using a lower-end device, where generation may take a
  couple of seconds.

  ## Version 0.0.46
  #### Jan 4, 2026

  * An external contributor added game-world-overview page. Thank you very much for your contribution!

<div>
  ## Version 0.0.45
  #### Dec 30, 2025

  * @Uzumaki added player pages! You'll now be able to see general information about each player, along with a list of
  their villages. Thank you very much for your contribution!

  ## Version 0.0.44
  #### Dec 24, 2025

  * UI color scheme (dark/light mode), graphic skin variant (default, snow,...), locale & graphics day-night setting are
  now persistent between game worlds. This doesn't mean much yet, because we don't have graphics, only support a single
  locale and don't have a dark mode yet, but once those things arrive, you'll be able to set them once and have the
  setting persist through all game worlds.

  * I've done a minor clean up. In this case, we managed to remove a minor dependency, which reduced the final bundle by
  about ~60kb.

<div>
  ## Version 0.0.43
  #### Dec 19, 2025

  * We now have a global not-found page. I've been seeing a small rise of routing errors lately. I'm not sure if these
  are just bots trying different subpages, but in case some real users are getting lost, this should help them out a
  bit.

  * I've reworked the in-game error pages for game world not found and game world is already opened errors. Instead of
  being redirected to /404 or /403, you'll now remain inside the relevant game world url. This reduces the amount of
  clicks needed to solve a particular error.

  ## Version 0.0.42
  #### Dec 12, 2025

  * I've merged the proposed fix for the layout shift by @Freeman! Thank you for your contribution, I really appreciate
  it!

  * I've substantially improved performance of the construct new building page. This page was actually flagged as one of
  the slowest pages we have. The reason for this is because in order to determine which buildings you're allowed to
  construct, we have to run a bunch of checks. While these checks are not that slow individually, we had to run these
  checks multiple times for each building, which added up quickly. I've now reworked this to make it more efficient. You
  should be seeing faster page renders, especially on mid/lower-end devices.
