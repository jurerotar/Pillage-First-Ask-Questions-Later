                  I've always been a huge fan of Travian and similar
                  browser-based strategy games. The slow, methodical
                  village-building, resource management, and real-time
                  progression made those games special.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Sadly, Travian requires a massive time (and gold!) investment
                  to remain competitive. Not being able to commit either of
                  these, I set out to create a similar, but less
                  commitment-hungry experience.

                  Yes, there's a couple. Main ones are new buildings, more
                  playable tribes, removal of capital village mechanic and new
                  hero items.
