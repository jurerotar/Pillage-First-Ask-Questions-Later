# Frequently asked questions

<section>
  ## What's the state of the project?

  Project is still pretty heavy in development! It's still missing a lot of major features. What's currently available
  is building construction, unit training, a couple of building interfaces, as well as secondary pages like
  production-overview, village-overview, map, preferences, statistics, player pages, oasis bonus finder,...

  **We've recently completed a rework of the game engine**, which has been a massive undertaking. This was previously
  taking the majority of development efforts, which will now go to new features!

  ## Is there a project roadmap available?

  Due to the nature of this project (I get work on it only in my free time), I'm not willing to commit to any specific
  timeline for any features. That being said, here's some of the **prioritized features**:

  * Combat mechanics
  * Trading mechanics
  * Hero adventures & inventory

  **Bug fixing and minor quality-of-life updates will take priority**.

  ## Are there game design differences between Travian and Pillage First!?

  Yes, there are a few! The main ones include planned new buildings, the removal of the capital village mechanic,
  expanded artifact system, planned new hero items and more NPC interactions. Mechanics are always up for discussion, so
  feel free to leave your thoughts! Game design is an ongoing conversation in <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                                                                 className="text-blue-500 underline"
                                                                                 target="_blank"

  ## Can this project be converted to multiplayer?

  **Yes!** This project was actually rebuilt from the ground up to make it as compatible as possible with a potential
  backend integration.

  That being said, the current goal is to keep this repository as a **standalone, offline-first app focused on
  single-player gameplay**.

  One of the hopes for the future of this project is that someone might eventually fork the project, restructure it, and
  connect it to a backend, enabling a multiplayer experience. Most of the frontend can be completely reused, making the
  transition easier than starting from scratch.

  **If you're passionate about backend development and want to help bring multiplayer to life, feel free to reach out!**

  ## How does the game continue running if the app is closed?

  In a nutshell, whenever you open a game world, we simulate every event that would have taken place, had the app been
  open all this time. These events would happen at some time in the past, but since app can't run without the browser
  being open, we resolve these events now. This means you can be attacked while offline, since this attack would also
  have happened if you were online.
  The major downside is that we can't know which events have happened until we actually open the game world and simulate
  the timeline. This means we can't let the player know if they're under attack, because the only way for us to know
  whether an attack has been triggered is to actually open the game.

  ## Why not stick with the original?

  While I love Travian, I (and many more like me) just don't have the time to commit to it anymore. Pulling
  all-nighters, finding duals from across the world and making sure account is covered 24/7 was fun in middle school,
  but it's not something I want to (or even can?) engage in now. I want to be able to take a break, whenever life gets
  in the way, and for the game to respect that.

  I want this game to be a **more accessible, customizable and time-friendly version of Travian**.

  ## Is this project in danger of being taken down due to copyright violations?

  We've made a lot of effort to differentiate this game from Travian. Even though Pillage First! is inspired by Travian,
  we've made (and plan for more) **fundamental gameplay, technological & design differences** between games.

  **Codebase has been written completely from scratch**. We're not using Travian codebase as a reference or any other
  reason
  in any stage of development.

  Art is completely handmade. We don't use or allow any Travian assets. Furthermore, we don't use and don't allow
  AI-transformed Travian assets to be used in this project.

  We also include legal notices on the page to explicitly differentiate this project from Travian.

  ## Does the game continue even if I close the app?

  **Yes!** You're free to close the app at any time and the game will pick off right next time you open it again! Units
  will continue to be trained, buildings will continue to be constructed and troops will continue to raid exactly as
  they would if you kept the app running.

  ## Are game worlds stable between new releases?

  **Sometimes, but most often not**. Despite this project being developed in my free-time only, we still have a
  relatively high update cadence. Typically, we push out 3-5 (mostly minor) updates per week. Most of these updates are
  completely safe and don't affect the underlying data structures that the app requires, but not always. Sometimes, even
  minor changes break the game world, either completely, or partially.
  <br />
  * **Until full release** - Until the full release of the game, I don't intend to keep worlds compatible between
  changes.
  This means game worlds should be expected to break relatively regularly and should only be used for testing the game
  out. I can't afford to spend time migrating old game states to new structures to keep compatibility, due to this
  slowing down development quite a bit.

  * **After full release** - After the game is officially released, I will commit to keeping game worlds stable between
  releases. This means that with each a game change, I'll also provide a script to migrate old game states to new ones.
  This process should be completely transparent to users.

  ## Why single-player?

  There are a few key reasons I chose to focus on single-player:

  - **Customizable gameplay** - Each of us has a different expectation of the game. Some players prefer speedier game
  worlds, some prefer more difficult opponents, while others look for a more peaceful coexisting with their neighbors.
  This isn't something that we can offer in a multiplayer setting, where you have no control of other players' actions.
  Thus, one of the goals of this app is to give you the power to customize your gameplay as much as possible. You'll be
  able to choose speed, difficulty (NPC troop levels,...) and more at server creation form!

  - **Respecting your time** - Most of us are not in high school anymore. Waking up at 3am to send out attacks may have
  been a valid strategy 10 years ago, but it's out of the question now. Because we realize real-life takes priority, we
  plan on adding multiple mechanism to help you balance game needs:
  - Unlimited vacation mode, available at any point for any reason
  - Ability to disable attacks while you're offline

  - **Moderation cost & complexity** - multiplayer comes with a whole layer of moderation challenges, things like chat
  filters, reporting tools, cheat prevention, account and support systems. They're not just one-time features either;
  they need constant upkeep and care. For a solo developer, that's a massive investment of time and energy that could
  easily overshadow the development of the actual game. Single-player allows me to limit the scope of the project and
  deliver faster.

  - **Offline-first** - One of the goals of this project is to allows players to load the app once and then have it work
  fully offline. This makes it more accessible to players with limited or unreliable internet access, and ensures the
  experience is consistent regardless of connection quality.

  ## Is there an in-game Wiki available?

  Not yet, but I can (officially?) confirm there's one in the making!

  It's going to include units (cost, attack and defence upgrade tables and durations), buildings (cost, upgrade
  durations), hero (exp tables and revive cost) and some general advice and tips.

  ## Is 10x the highest supporter game world speed?

  Yes. This might get revised upwards in the future. The limiting factor here is players' own devices. Since the app
  runs 100% on your device, we can't really guarantee good performance. Higher speed game worlds require more device
  resources, and maxing these out could cause lag, excessive battery drain and other issues.

  A 10x speed appears stable even on lower-end devices, which is why this speed was determined to be the higher limit
  for now.
