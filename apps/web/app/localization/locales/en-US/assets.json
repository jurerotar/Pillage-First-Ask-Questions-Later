Phalanx is the cheapest of all Gaul units and though it is not very strong or fast, it is considered by many to be the best defensive unit in the game per resource unit. Unlike all other defenders, phalanx is very balanced between infantry defense and cavalry defense. The best use of the phalanx is as stationary defense and for anticipating future attacks well in advance. Because of its slow travel speed it should be complemented with Druidriders for quick reinforcements until the Phalanx has time to arrive. With the introduction of version 3.5, phalanx now has more capacity and therefore, can be used as an early infantry raider."
